# against-Grain

There's always someone curating a new way of using
Or applying an old product of some sorts! 
But with so many different and unique ideas and 
People it's become somewhat of a challenge 
To stand out as someone who's idea trumps all others.

I'm here today and many more to come, as I try out
Different ideas and figuring out which ones 
Catch the eyes and peak the interest, and also
Draw in the crowd.

So here I am today and hopefully tomorrow and days
To come, I will give different texts and 
Speeches that will teach a different and new
Crowd of entrepreneurs and beginning business owners
Small and big, men and woman, how I made my 
Impact.
